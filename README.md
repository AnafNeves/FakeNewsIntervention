# FakeNewsIntervention

The purpose of this repo is to construct, share, and record the psychology experiment I propose for my third analytical chapter as part of Rob Dickinson's PhD at University of Sussex. 

I will be attempting to store all relevant files here, with the possible exceptions of my zotero bibliography files and my personal reading notes that I take on OneNote. If I can find a way to link zotero and onenote properly, i'll include them too. 

I am new to Github, so it is highly likely there will be mistakes as I get used to it. If you encounter something that should be here but isn't, or something that shouldn't be here but is, please get in touch with me.
